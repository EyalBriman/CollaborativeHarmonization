# CollaborativeHarmonization
We are developing aggregation methods that incorporate specific global constraints, allowing people to collaboratively decide on harmonizing a melody.  The algorithms we do:
Majority, Majority with 2-gram, Kemeny Rule, Kemeny Rule with 2-gram, and Kemeny Clustering for proportional harmonization.
